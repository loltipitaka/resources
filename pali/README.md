The `world-tipitaka` folder contains a structured and cleaned up dump of the Mahasangiti pali texts.

The origin of this was https://github.com/yuttadhammo/World-Tipitaka, the texts are derived from `tipitaka/data` which contains a flat dump of XML files (for certain, horrifying, definitions of XML) as produced by a site crawler. The cleaning up consisted of removing some purely navigational elements. The structuring reproduces the nesting they used on their site.

The `world-tipitaka` folder also contains `menu.json` which contains the pitaka and division structure, this is derived from `index.html` in the prior mentioned repository which was probably also directly ripped from the World Tipiktaka site.
