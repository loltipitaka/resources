The `world-tipitaka` folder contains a structured and cleaned up dump of the Mahasangiti pali texts.

The origin of this was https://github.com/yuttadhammo/World-Tipitaka/tree/master/tipitaka/data which contains a flat dump of XML files (for certain definitions of XML) as produced by a site crawler. The cleaning up consists of removing some purely navigational elements. The structuring reproduces the nesting they used on their site.
